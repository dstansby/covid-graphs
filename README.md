# Covid plots

Covid by Numbers: Making Sense of the Pandemic with Data by David Spiegelhalter
and Anthony Masters is a great book, with many intersting plots relating to
the Covid pandemic. Those graphs are frozen in time in the book however; this
repository contains code to automatically download data and reproduce up to
date versions of those graphs.
